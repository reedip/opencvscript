This repository is just a collection of scripts which I am
trying out to test out OpenCV and see if I can actually create
something out of it.

I am checking some dummy projects, and the following are the targets
of this repository ( which might change as the requirements/sample use
cases are found)

- Identify the Gender and Age of a Person in a Photograph using OpenCV
  This is very similar to what is there in Mobile Phones. Lets see if this
  can be done and included into RaspberryPi :)
